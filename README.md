# Real-Time Facial Expression Recognition

## Overview
This project implements real-time facial expression recognition using deep learning techniques. The code provided here is adapted from the article [Real-Time Face Expression Recognition](https://medium.com/@dana.fatadilla123/real-time-face-expression-recognition-b2214b6cdfb9).

## Pretrained Model
The model architecture used in this project is based on EfficientNetB7, a convolutional neural network pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The EfficientNetB7 model is employed as a feature extractor, followed by a custom classification head.

## Setup and Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Download the FER2013 dataset and place it in the appropriate directory structure as described in the code.
4. Ensure proper data preprocessing by executing the provided code.
5. Train the model by running the main script.
